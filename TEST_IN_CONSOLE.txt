🧪 CORRECT WAY TO TEST IN CONSOLE

The issue: app is a FUNCTION, not an object!

❌ WRONG:
app.draftWhatsAppMessage
(This returns undefined because app is a function)

✅ CORRECT - Test 1:
app().draftWhatsAppMessage

This calls app() and checks if the function exists.

✅ CORRECT - Test 2:
typeof app
(Should return "function")

✅ CORRECT - Test 3:
Just test the actual feature!
1. Click "📱 Send to Customer" button
2. See if it works now

---

EVEN BETTER: Skip console testing entirely and just try the feature!
The code is in the file, so just use it.
