🔥 BYPASS CACHE WITH URL VERSION PARAMETER

If closing/reopening tabs doesn't work, try adding a version parameter to the URL:

Instead of:
http://localhost:8000

Use:
http://localhost:8000?v=20260211

This tricks the browser into thinking it's a different page, bypassing ALL cache.

Change the number if you need to reload again:
http://localhost:8000?v=20260211b
http://localhost:8000?v=20260211c

This ALWAYS works because the browser treats ?v=xxx as a unique URL.
